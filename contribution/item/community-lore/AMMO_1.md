No one truly knows how the Energy Cells are mass produced, but what is known, is that they take skill, parts to ammunition, and effort to make one yourself.
Grasping the cells in your hand, they almost quiver in your tightening grip. An eerie aura bounces off their shiny exterior and into the dank darkness beyond.
You grasp them ever tighter, feeling their warmth embrace you, like a familiar friend. 
It's all you have left, really.
